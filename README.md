## 📖 The Story

Programming isn't just about business logic; it's about capturing moments. **MyLoveTime** is a personal project designed to bridge the gap between time and memory. 

I wanted a minimalistic, "always-on" display that could live on my lock screen, float on my desktop while I code, or run in the browser—reminding me of the journey so far. It features a custom "Dark Mode" aesthetic (#2b2a2b) that is easy on the eyes and a precise time calculation engine that accounts for leap years and specific time-of-day starts.

## ✨ Features

* **⚡ Real-Time Precision:** Updates every second to calculate Years, Months, Days, Hours, Minutes, and Seconds.
* **🎨 Dual Themes:** Seamless toggle between "Midnight Code" (Dark) and "Soft Rose" (Light).
* **📱 Cross-Platform:**
    * **Web:** Responsive Next.js application.
    * **Desktop:** Frameless, transparent widget using Electron.
    * **Mobile:** Native-feeling widgets via Scriptable (iOS) and KWGT (Android).
* **🧩 Modular Architecture:** Built with Separation of Concerns (SoC) in mind, making components reusable and maintainable.

* **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router)
* **Language:** TypeScript
